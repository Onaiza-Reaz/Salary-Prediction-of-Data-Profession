****Project Title****

Salary Prediction of Data Professions

**Description:**

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook code for developing and evaluating data-driven models to predict salaries for data professionals. The project leverages several machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Ridge Regression.

**Key Features:**

Preprocessing and exploration of a dataset containing information about data professionals and their salaries.

Implementation of various machine learning models for salary prediction.

Performance evaluation of models using metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Comparison of models to select the best-performing predictor for salary estimation.

**Dependencies:**

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

sklearn

**Instructions:**

Run the code cells in the notebook sequentially to perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

**Results:**

The analysis reveals statistically significant relationships between certain features and salary levels.

Among the evaluated models, Random Forest Regression emerged as the most accurate predictor with an R-squared value of 93.16%, signifying strong explanatory power.

Visualization with actual vs. predicted values plots offers insights into model performance and potential areas for improvement.

**Disclaimer:**

This project is for educational purposes only and does not guarantee accurate salary predictions in real-world scenarios.

The dataset might not be comprehensive or fully representative of the data science workforce.

**Additional Notes:**

Feel free to modify and improve the analysis as needed.
